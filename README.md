Thoughful Words is designed by Mick Arnold and Aanchal Saxena to help designers avoid potentially triggering words. 

As a technical communications (and UX) major, Mick has always been passionate about UX copywriting and finds that word choice is a skill a lot of UX designers are lacking. This passion combined with Mick and Aanchal's passion for equality and inclusion sparked the idea of Thoughtful Words. 

Because this was their first time creating a plug in and programming in Javascript, the current version is just a proof of concept - it only marks TextNodes as a whole and doesn't parse through to assess individual words or phrases yet, but that feature will be added within this upcoming week. 

The app currently just makes designers aware of the language, but the next step after perfecting the functionality is to create a system that gives suggestions for better word choices instead of just creating awareness.
